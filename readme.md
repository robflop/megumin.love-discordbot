# Megumin.love Discord bot
A discord bot to go along with my website, [megumin.love](https://megumin.love)!

Written using discord.js, using opusscript, request and moment packages.

## Usage
- Fill out your bot token and change the ownerID in config.json to your devmode discord ID.
- Adjust config.json to your liking
- ``npm install`` to install all dependencies
- Run it!

Optional: Once you've got it running on a linux server, install node-opus for better performance than opusscript.

(Opusscript used for development on windows)

###### Information
- The default version of the bot uses the ``sounds/`` directory to look for sounds.- 
- Shutdown, gamechange, sound logs, error logs and server logs are saved in the ``log/`` directory by default.
- By default, a command cooldown of 3 seconds is applied.

Change these settings to your liking.
