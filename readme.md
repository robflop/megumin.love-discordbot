# Megumin.love Discord bot
A discord bot to go along with my website, [megumin.love](https://megumin.love)!

Written using discord.js, using opusscript and request packages.

## Usage
- Fill out your bot token and change the ownerID in config.js to your devmode discord ID.
- Adjust config.json to your liking
- ``npm install`` to install all dependencies
- Run it!

###### Information
The default version of the bot uses the ``sounds/`` directory to look for sounds.
Change this to your liking.
Shutdown, gamechange and sound logs are saved in the ``log/`` directory by default.
