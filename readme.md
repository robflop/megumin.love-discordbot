# Megumin.love Discord bot
A discord bot to go along with my website, [megumin.love](https://megumin.love)!

Written using discord.js, using opusscript and request packages.

## Usage
- Adjust config.json to your liking (fill out your bot token!)
- ``npm install`` to install all dependencies
- Run it!

###### Information
The default version of the bot uses the ``sounds/`` directory to look for sounds. Change this to your liking.
Shutdown and gamechange logs are saved in the same directory the base file, app.js, is saved in by default.
